# text_file_counter 

This project is designed to take all .txt files in specified folder and count the top 10 most frequently used words both overall and for each individual file. These results are reported in a document stored in another folder specified by the user.

To use the program, run main.py.

To test this program for bugs, run "test_function.py". This should create a folder called "Test_case_reports" containing a report on the ".txt" files in the folder "test_data".
