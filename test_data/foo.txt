This is a random file with some text to use as an example for the file finder. Nothing of particular interest will be included in this file so
don't worry about that. Also, here is an awkward	tab to make things harder. Hopefully all of this text will be separated correctly so the words
can be counted. If it doesn't then the test should catch the problem and it can be fixed. Will we be able to stop this though? Let's assume
we can write more. Will I stop writing the word will? More wills will come as it is nice text to see.
