This text is even less interesting than that in foo. It is completely meaningless and only exists to test the code. Foo and bar are used as
placeholder names which apparently has its origins in military slang. Now 	 I am just padding the text out to get some more words for more
comparisions. Speaking of which here are even more words that are padding out the file even further. Isn't it nice that the words keep coming?
I hope I can stop soon. This should be nearly enough words which is good... or maybe not we simply don't know.
